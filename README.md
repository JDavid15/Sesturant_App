# Sesturant_App

This was the app I created for my Android Final Project in my University.

Sesturant is a restaurant tracker (powered by the Zomato API) that shows all of the near by restaurants and provides information on them.
User can also save their favorites restaurants locally to the device.
When theuser tapps on one of the locations, the app shows basic information about the restaurant like images (if provided by the API), price estimation, food type, GPS location, and  more.

Installation: 
Intall the App via APK on any device (APK included in this GitHub file as "app-release.apk"), run in Android Stuio or Drag and Drop the APK file ("app-release.apk") on a Android Stuio Phone Emulator

Requirements:
An Android phone with internet connection and location (or GPS) on.

Important:
Since the Zomato API is limited, only a few restaurants will be showed. More infomation on: https://developers.zomato.com/documentation#/
